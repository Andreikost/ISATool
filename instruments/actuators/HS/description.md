### Hand Switch (HS)
A Hand Switch is a device operated by a person to initiate an action in the control system. It can be a simple push button, a two or three-position selector switch, or an emergency mushroom button.

**Function:** It provides a direct interface for the plant operator to intervene in the process. It allows starting or stopping a motor, opening or closing a valve, or changing the mode of a control loop from automatic to manual.

**Common Applications:** Local control panels next to equipment for maintenance or local start/stop (e.g., H-O-A: Hand-Off-Auto), emergency stop buttons, and mode selectors in control rooms.
