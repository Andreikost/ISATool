### I/P Converter (IY)
An I/P (Current-to-Pressure) Converter is a type of transducer that converts an analog electrical control signal (usually 4-20 mA) into a proportional pneumatic pressure signal (usually 3-15 psi or 0.2-1 bar). The letter 'Y' in ISA often denotes a relay, converter, or calculation.

**Function:** It acts as a bridge between modern electronic control systems (PLC, DCS) and older or simpler pneumatic actuators, such as control valves that do not have a digital positioner.

**Common Applications:** Interfacing the analog output of a controller with the actuator of a pneumatic valve. It allows the electronic system to precisely modulate the valve's opening by varying the air pressure.
