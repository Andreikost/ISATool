### Pump (P)
A pump is a machine used to transfer a fluid (liquid or gas) from one place to another, usually increasing its pressure. In P&ID diagrams, it is represented as an actuator, as it is an element that performs work on the process, usually driven by a motor.

**Common Types:**
- **Centrifugal:** Use a rotating impeller to accelerate the fluid.
- **Positive Displacement:** Trap a fixed volume of fluid and force it out (e.g., piston pumps, gear pumps).

**Common Applications:** Transporting raw materials and products, cooling systems, boiler feed, etc.
