### Pressure Safety Valve (PSV)
A Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) is a self-operated protection device. Its function is to open automatically when the pressure in a system or vessel exceeds a preset value (setpoint), releasing the excess pressure to prevent an explosion or equipment damage.

**Operating Principle:** A calibrated spring keeps the valve closed. When the force exerted by the fluid pressure overcomes the spring force, the valve opens quickly and fully. It closes automatically when the pressure returns to a safe level.

**Common Applications:** It is a mandatory safety element on pressure vessels such as boilers, reactors, and storage tanks.
