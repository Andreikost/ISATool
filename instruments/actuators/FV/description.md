### Flow Valve (FV)
A Flow Valve, also known as a control valve, is an actuator that modulates the passage of a fluid in a pipe. It can be positioned anywhere between fully open and fully closed to precisely regulate flow, pressure, level, or temperature.

**Components:**
- **Body:** The part that contains the fluid.
- **Plug/Disc:** The internal element that moves to restrict flow.
- **Actuator:** The mechanism (pneumatic, electric, or hydraulic) that moves the plug.
- **Positioner:** An intelligent device that ensures the valve moves to the exact position commanded by the controller.

**Common Applications:** It is the most common final control element in the process industry.
