### Motor (M)
In the context of ISA instrumentation, a motor is an actuator that converts electrical energy into rotational mechanical energy. It is the device responsible for driving equipment such as pumps, compressors, fans, or conveyor belts.

**Control:** Its control can be simple (start/stop) or complex, using a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) to regulate its speed and, therefore, control the flow of a pump or fan.

**Common Applications:** Driving virtually any type of rotating machinery in an industrial plant.
