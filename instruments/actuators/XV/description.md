### On/Off Valve (XV)
An On/Off Valve, also known as a shut-off or block valve, is an actuator designed to be in one of two positions: fully open or fully closed. It is not used for fine flow regulation.

**Operating Principle:** It is operated by an actuator (usually a solenoid or a quarter-turn actuator) that receives a discrete signal (on/off) from the control system.

**Common Applications:** Safety systems to quickly shut off flow (ESD - Emergency Shutdown), isolating equipment for maintenance, or in batch processes where a tank needs to be completely filled or emptied.
