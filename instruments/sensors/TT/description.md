### Temperature Transmitter (TT)
A Temperature Transmitter is a device that measures the temperature of a process and converts this measurement into a standardized electrical signal (usually 4-20 mA or a digital signal). This signal is transmitted to a control system, such as a PLC or DCS, for monitoring and control.

**Operating Principle:** It uses a primary sensor (like a thermocouple or RTD) to detect temperature. The transmitter's internal electronics amplify, linearize, and convert the sensor's signal into the standard output signal.

**Common Applications:** Temperature control in chemical reactors, furnaces, HVAC systems, and monitoring the temperature of fluids in pipes and tanks.
