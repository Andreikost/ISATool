### Radiation Transmitter (RT)
A Radiation Transmitter uses a low-intensity radioactive source and a detector to perform non-contact measurements. The amount of radiation that reaches the detector is attenuated by the process material, which allows for inferring variables such as level, density, or thickness.

**Operating Principle:** A source (usually Cesium-137 or Cobalt-60) emits gamma rays. On the other side of the vessel or pipe, a detector measures the intensity of the received radiation. The transmitter calculates the process variable based on the attenuation of this radiation.

**Common Applications:** Level measurement in tanks with extreme conditions (high temperature, pressure, corrosive fluids), density measurement of slurries or pulps, and thickness measurement in rolling mills.
