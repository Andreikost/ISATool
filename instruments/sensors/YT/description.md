### Vibration Transmitter (YT)
A Vibration Transmitter measures the mechanical oscillations of rotating equipment like motors, pumps, or turbines. It is a key tool in predictive maintenance for detecting impending failures.

**Operating Principle:** It uses accelerometers or proximity sensors to capture the vibration. The transmitter's electronics process this signal to obtain parameters such as the velocity or acceleration of the vibration and transmit it to the control system.

**Common Applications:** Monitoring the health of critical machinery to detect imbalances, misalignments, or bearing problems before they cause a major failure.
