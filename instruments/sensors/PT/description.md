### Pressure Transmitter (PT)
A Pressure Transmitter measures the pressure of a gas or liquid within a system and converts it into a proportional electrical signal. This signal is sent to a control system for monitoring and automatic decision-making.

**Operating Principle:** It typically uses a diaphragm or a piezoresistive sensor that deforms under the fluid's pressure. This deformation results in a change in electrical resistance, which is processed by the transmitter's electronics to generate the output signal.

**Common Applications:** Pressure measurement in pipes, tanks, reactors, hydraulic, and pneumatic systems.
