### Weight Transmitter (WT)
A Weight Transmitter converts the signal from one or more load cells (force sensors) into a standardized process signal. It measures the weight of material in tanks, silos, or on conveyor belts.

**Operating Principle:** Load cells deform under weight, generating a small electrical signal. The weight transmitter (often called a weight indicator) amplifies, filters, and converts this signal into a readable weight value and transmits it to a control system.

**Common Applications:** Batch dosing systems, inventory control in silos, mass flow measurement on conveyor belts, and truck weighing systems.
