### Level Transmitter (LT)
A Level Transmitter is used to measure the height of a liquid or solid material within a container (tank, silo, etc.) and transmit that information as an electrical signal. It is crucial for inventory control and for preventing tank overflows or emptying.

**Operating Principle:** There are various technologies, such as differential pressure (measures hydrostatic pressure), radar, ultrasound, capacitance, or floats. The transmitter converts the sensor's measurement into a standard signal.

**Common Applications:** Level control in storage tanks for chemicals, water, food, and in silos for grains or powders.
