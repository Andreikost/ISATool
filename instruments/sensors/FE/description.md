### Flow Element (FE)
A Flow Element is a device that is inserted into a pipe and generates a measurable physical change in response to the fluid's flow. This change is then measured by a transmitter to calculate the flow rate.

**Common Types:**
- **Orifice Plate:** A plate with a hole that creates a pressure drop proportional to the square of the flow rate.
- **Venturi Tube:** A gradual narrowing that also generates a pressure drop.
- **Turbine:** A propeller that rotates at a speed proportional to the flow.

**Common Applications:** Flow measurement in combination with a differential pressure transmitter.
