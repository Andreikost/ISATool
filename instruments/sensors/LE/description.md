### Level Element (LE)
A Level Element is the primary sensor that detects the height of the material in a vessel. Its output can be a direct indication or a signal that a transmitter converts to an industrial standard.

**Common Types:**
- **Float:** A buoyant object that rises and falls with the liquid level.
- **Conductivity Probes:** Detect the presence of a conductive liquid at different heights.
- **Sight Glass:** A simple transparent tube that shows the level directly.

**Common Applications:** Level detection in tanks, cisterns, and reservoirs.
