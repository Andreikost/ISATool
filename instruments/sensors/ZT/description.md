### Position Transmitter (ZT)
A Position Transmitter is used to determine the position of a mechanical element, commonly the stem of a control valve. It provides feedback to the control system to confirm that the valve has moved to the desired point.

**Operating Principle:** It can be of the contact type (using a potentiometer) or non-contact (using magnetic effects like Hall or LVDT). It measures linear or angular displacement and converts it into an electrical signal.

**Common Applications:** Confirming the opening or closing of control valves, monitoring the position of dampers or linear actuators.
