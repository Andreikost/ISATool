### Analytical Transmitter (AT)
An Analytical Transmitter measures a specific chemical or physical property of a substance, such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), or oxidation-reduction potential (ORP).

**Operating Principle:** It uses a specific probe or electrode for the variable to be measured. The probe generates a small electrical signal (e.g., a voltage in the case of pH) which the transmitter converts into a standard and robust output signal.

**Common Applications:** Wastewater treatment, quality control in the food and pharmaceutical industries, and monitoring of chemical processes.
