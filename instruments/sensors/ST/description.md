### Speed Transmitter (ST)
A Speed Transmitter measures the rotational speed of a shaft, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM). It is a crucial sensor for monitoring and controlling rotating machinery such as motors, turbines, and compressors.

**Operating Principle:** They often use proximity sensors (inductive or Hall effect) that detect the passage of gear teeth or marks on the rotating shaft. The transmitter counts these pulses over a time interval and calculates the rotational speed, converting it into an analog (4-20 mA) or digital signal.

**Common Applications:** Speed control of motors using variable frequency drives (VFDs), overspeed protection in turbines, and monitoring the performance of pumps and fans.
