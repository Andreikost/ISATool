### Flow Transmitter (FT)
A Flow Transmitter measures the amount of a fluid passing through a pipe in a given period of time (flow rate) and converts it into an electrical signal.

**Operating Principle:** They can be based on different principles, such as differential pressure across an orifice plate, vortex shedding frequency (vortex), or electromagnetic or mass measurement (Coriolis). The electronics convert this physical measurement into a 4-20 mA or digital signal.

**Common Applications:** Measurement of water, steam, gas, chemical, and fuel flow in industrial processes for dosing control and billing.
