### Pressure Element (PE)
A Pressure Element is the sensing component that converts the force exerted by a fluid (pressure) into a mechanical displacement or an initial electrical signal. It is the fundamental part of a pressure gauge, pressure switch, or pressure transmitter.

**Common Types:**
- **Bourdon Tube:** A curved tube that tends to straighten with pressure.
- **Diaphragm:** A flexible membrane that deforms.
- **Piezoresistive Cell:** A semiconductor material whose resistance changes when deformed by pressure.

**Common Applications:** Main component in all pressure measurement devices.
