### pH Transmitter (pHT)
A pH Transmitter is a specific type of analytical transmitter dedicated to measuring the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution. It is a fundamental instrument in water treatment and many chemical processes.

**Operating Principle:** It uses a pH electrode that generates a millivolt voltage proportional to the solution's pH. Because this signal is very weak and has high impedance, the transmitter amplifies it, compensates for temperature (using a separate temperature probe), and converts it into a robust 4-20 mA signal.

**Common Applications:** pH control in chemical reactors, monitoring of effluents in water treatment plants, and quality control in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries.
