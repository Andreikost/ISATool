### Temperature Element (TE)
A Temperature Element is the primary sensor that is in direct contact with the process to detect its temperature. It does not transmit a standardized signal by itself, but rather generates a signal that must be interpreted by a transmitter (TT) or a controller (TC).

**Common Types:**
- **Thermocouple:** Formed by the junction of two different metals that generate a small voltage proportional to the temperature.
- **RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector):** Usually made of platinum (Pt100), its electrical resistance changes predictably with temperature.

**Common Applications:** It is the fundamental component in any temperature measurement loop.
