### Temperature Indicator (TI)
A Temperature Indicator is a device that displays the value of a process temperature to operators. It can be a local device (a dial thermometer installed on the pipe) or a digital display on a control panel that receives the signal from a transmitter.

**Operating Principle:**
- **Local:** A bimetallic or bulb thermometer that moves a needle on a graduated scale.
- **Remote:** A digital screen that displays the numerical value received from a Temperature Transmitter (TT).

**Common Applications:** Allows for quick visual monitoring of the process status by plant personnel.
