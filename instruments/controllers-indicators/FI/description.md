### Flow Indicator (FI)
A Flow Indicator shows the flow rate of a fluid in a pipe.

**Operating Principle:**
- **Local:** It can be a rotameter, which consists of a float inside a tapered transparent tube, where the height indicates the flow rate.
- **Remote:** A digital display that shows the value measured by a Flow Transmitter (FT). Often, these indicators can also totalize the volume that has passed.

**Common Applications:** Monitoring the flow of coolants, fuels, or products to ensure the process is operating correctly.
