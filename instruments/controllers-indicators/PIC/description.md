### Pressure Indicating Controller (PIC)
A Pressure Indicating Controller combines the functions of three devices in one:
- **Indicator (I):** Displays the current pressure value.
- **Transmitter (T):** Measures the pressure and has the control electronics (although the measurement is taken by a primary element).
- **Controller (C):** Compares the pressure with a setpoint and generates an output signal.

They are very common panel-mounted devices that allow the operator to see the variable, see the setpoint, and change the controller's mode (Auto/Manual) from a single location. Equivalents exist for temperature (TIC), level (LIC), and flow (FIC).
