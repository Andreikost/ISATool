### Low Pressure Switch (PSL)
A Low Pressure Switch is the complement to the PSH. It is a protection device that changes the state of its contact when the system pressure drops below a critical setpoint.

**Function:** It provides a discrete (on/off) signal to indicate a low-pressure condition, which can often be dangerous or detrimental to the equipment.

**Common Applications:** Protecting a pump by ensuring there is sufficient suction pressure (NPSH), detecting a leak in a system, or ensuring that the pressure of a sealing gas is maintained above a minimum. The 'L' indicates it acts on 'Low'.
