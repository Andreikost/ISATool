### Speed Controller (SC)
A Speed Controller maintains the rotational speed (RPM) of a piece of equipment at a desired setpoint value. It is analogous to other controllers, but its process variable is speed.

**Function:** It receives the measurement from a Speed Transmitter (ST), compares it with the setpoint, and adjusts an output to correct any deviation. This output typically manipulates a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD), which in turn adjusts the motor's speed.

**Common Applications:** Precise speed control of conveyor belts, screw feeders, mixers, and extruders to ensure product quality and process consistency.
