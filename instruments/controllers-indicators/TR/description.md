### Temperature Recorder (TR)
A Temperature Recorder is an instrument that stores the history of one or more temperature measurements over time. The 'R' stands for 'Recorder'.

**Operating Principle:**
- **Traditional:** A paper recorder that uses a pen to draw a graph of the temperature on a circular or strip chart that rotates at a constant speed.
- **Modern:** A paperless recorder that displays trends on an LCD screen and stores the data in internal memory or on an SD card.

**Common Applications:** Processes that require a documented record for quality or safety regulations, such as in the food (pasteurization) and pharmaceutical industries. It is also used for troubleshooting and process optimization.
