### Level Controller (LC)
A Level Controller automates the filling or emptying of a tank to maintain the level at a specific setpoint. It receives the signal from a Level Transmitter (LT) and sends a signal to an inlet valve or an outlet pump.

**Control Types:** It can be modulating control (using a control valve to continuously adjust the inlet/outlet flow) or on-off control (starting/stopping a pump between two level points).

**Common Applications:** Preventing overflow or emptying of process tanks, maintaining a constant level in a separator.
