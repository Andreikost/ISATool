### Pressure Indicator (PI)
A Pressure Indicator, commonly known as a pressure gauge, is a device that displays the pressure of a fluid. Like the temperature indicator, it can be local or remote.

**Operating Principle:**
- **Local:** A gauge with a Bourdon tube that moves a needle over a scale.
- **Remote:** A digital display in a control room that shows the value measured by a Pressure Transmitter (PT).

**Common Applications:** Installed on pipes and vessels so operators can check the pressure locally and quickly, especially for safety and operational reasons.
