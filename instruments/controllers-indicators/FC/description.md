### Flow Controller (FC)
A Flow Controller maintains the flow rate of a fluid through a pipe at a setpoint value. It receives the measurement from a Flow Transmitter (FT) and adjusts a Flow Valve (FV) to regulate the fluid's passage.

**Importance:** Flow control loops are very common and are often "slave" loops in more complex control strategies, such as cascade control.

**Common Applications:** Precise dosing of reagents, controlling the feed flow to a process, and mixing different fluid streams.
