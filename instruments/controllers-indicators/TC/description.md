### Temperature Controller (TC)
A Temperature Controller is the "brain" of a temperature control loop. Its function is to:
1. Receive the temperature measurement from a transmitter (TT) or a sensor (TE).
2. Compare this measurement with a desired value (Setpoint).
3. Calculate a control action (using an algorithm like PID) to minimize the error.
4. Send an output signal to an actuator (like a steam control valve) to adjust the process.

**Location:** It can be an individual panel device or a software function within a PLC or DCS.
