### High Temperature Alarm (TAH)
A High Temperature Alarm is a function, usually implemented in the control system's software (PLC/DCS), that notifies the operator when a temperature measurement exceeds a predefined threshold.

**Function:** Unlike a switch (TSH), which is a field device, an alarm (TAH) is a logical function that takes the signal from a transmitter (TT). Its purpose is to alert the operator via the graphical interface (HMI) with a message, a color change, or a sound, allowing them to take corrective action before an emergency shutdown level is reached.

**Common Applications:** In virtually any process where temperature is a critical variable, to warn of overheating in reactors, motor bearings, furnaces, etc.
