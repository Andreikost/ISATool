### Low Level Switch (LSL)
A Low Level Switch is a protection device that changes the state of an electrical contact when the level of a liquid or solid in a tank drops below a critical setpoint.

**Function:** The 'L' stands for 'Low'. It acts when the level is too low.

**Common Applications:** Protecting a pump from running dry (which would damage it), activating a low raw material alarm, or initiating an automatic filling sequence.
