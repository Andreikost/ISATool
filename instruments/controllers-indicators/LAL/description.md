### Low Level Alarm (LAL)
A Low Level Alarm is a logical function within the control system that alerts the operator when the level in a tank or vessel drops below a warning threshold.

**Function:** Like the TAH, the LAL takes its value from a continuous transmitter (LT) and generates a notification on the HMI. It allows the operator to intervene before the level drops to a critical point that could trigger a low-level switch (LSL) and stop a pump.

**Common Applications:** Warning about the need to replenish raw material in a day tank, notifying of a possible emptying of a storage tank, or indicating problems with filling a vessel.
