### Flow Totalizer Indicator (FQI)
A Flow Totalizer Indicator combines two functions: it indicates the instantaneous flow rate (like an FI) and also integrates (sums) that flow rate over time to calculate the total volume of fluid that has passed.

**Function:** The 'Q' stands for 'Quantity'. Essentially, it's a volume or mass counter. It displays the current flow rate (e.g., in m³/h) and the accumulated volume (e.g., in m³). Often, this total can be reset.

**Common Applications:** Measuring water, gas, or steam consumption for billing, controlling the amount of reactant added in a batch process, and loading/unloading tanker trucks.
