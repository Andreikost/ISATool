### High Flow Switch (FSH)
A High Flow Switch is a device that activates when the flow rate of a fluid in a pipe exceeds a predetermined value.

**Operating Principle:** It can be a paddle that is pushed by the flow, or it can be based on thermal dispersion. It does not measure the exact flow value, but simply detects if the flow is higher than its setpoint.

**Common Applications:** Activating an alarm if the coolant flow is excessive, or as part of a safety system to detect a possible pipe rupture downstream.
