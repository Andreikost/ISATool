### Pressure Controller (PC)
A Pressure Controller performs the same function as a TC, but for the pressure variable. It compares the measured pressure (from a PT) with a setpoint and manipulates an actuator (like a valve or a pump's speed) to maintain the pressure at the desired value.

**Operating Principle:** It uses a control algorithm (usually PID) to calculate the necessary output to correct any deviation of the pressure from the setpoint.

**Common Applications:** Maintaining constant pressure in a reactor, controlling the pressure in a gas or steam line.
