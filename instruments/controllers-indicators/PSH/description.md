### High Pressure Switch (PSH)
A High Pressure Switch is a protection device that changes the state of an electrical contact when the system pressure exceeds a predefined setpoint.

**Function:** It does not provide a continuous measurement, only a discrete (on/off) indication that a high-pressure condition has been reached. It is used to activate safety interlocks or alarms.

**Common Applications:** Shutting down a pump to prevent over-pressurization of a pipe, activating a high-pressure alarm, or opening an emergency vent valve. The 'H' indicates it acts on 'High'.
