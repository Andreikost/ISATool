### Level Indicator (LI)
A Level Indicator is a device that shows the height of the material inside a tank or vessel.

**Operating Principle:**
- **Local:** It can be a simple glass sight tube mounted on the side of the tank, or a magnetic indicator with a float that moves a series of colored flippers.
- **Remote:** A display on a panel that shows the value coming from a Level Transmitter (LT).

**Common Applications:** Monitoring inventory in storage tanks and visual control of filling or emptying.
