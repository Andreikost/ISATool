### High Temperature Switch (TSH)
A High Temperature Switch is a protection device. Unlike a transmitter, it does not measure the analog value of the temperature, but simply changes the state of an electrical contact (from open to closed or vice versa) when the temperature exceeds a predefined setpoint.

**Function:** The 'H' stands for 'High'. It acts when the temperature is too high.

**Common Applications:** Activating an audible or visual alarm, or triggering an emergency shutdown of a piece of equipment to prevent overheating and damage.
