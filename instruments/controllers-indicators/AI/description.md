### Analytical Indicator (AI)
An Analytical Indicator displays the value of a chemical or physical measurement, such as pH, conductivity, or the concentration of a gas.

**Operating Principle:** It is almost always a device with a digital display that is connected to an Analytical Transmitter (AT). It shows the value of the variable in the corresponding units (e.g., "7.2 pH").

**Common Applications:** Control panels in water treatment plants to monitor pH, or in industrial areas to display the concentration of hazardous gases.
